  "description" : "[quote]\"The Wasp Hives were discovered by the Terrene Protectorate in a state of primitive medieval culture - each Hive was a veritable kingdom of their own, with one queen acting as the brain and many drones acting as queen's eyes and hands.\"[/quote]\n\nIn response to their discovery, Wasp Hives eventually learned to embrace their individuality and work together for the greater good. Play as a Hive and you'll get:\n\n[b]- Original humanoid-insect sprites that are clothing friendly\n- A unique fully tiered ship, that includes matching doors, SAIL, Locker, Fuel hatch and a special animated teleporter\n- 3 custom codexes outlining the discovery of the new species[/b]\n\n[b]- Paper comb furniture set:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Stackable paper comb chair and chest\n[*] Paper comb armchair\n[*] Paper comb table and cooking table\n[*] Wall mounted bookshelf and standing bookcase\n[*] Paper comb bed\n[*] Hanging light\n[*] Tileable wall-mounted small lights, buttons, and switches\n[*] Two doors and a small gate\n[/list]\n\n[b]- Wall-mounted, tileable set:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] locker\n[*] large light\n[*] large button\n[*] large switch \n[*] a set of logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Timer)\n[*] alcove bed\n[*] breakfast/study nook that includes a chair and 2x2 table\n[*] bookshelf\n[*] microwave\n[*] blank hexagons for filling in any spaces with style\n[*] wall-mounted comb top, bottom and corner pieces\n[*] a set of wall-mounted shelves, from small to large\n[/list]\n\n[b]- Paper tileset:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] paper comb wall\n[*] paper comb support\n[*] paper comb beam\n[*] paper comb platform\n[*] glass comb block\n[/list]\n\n[b]- Items:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] wasp wings back item! Given automatically to the new characters or crafted using an item at the apothecary.\nWings allow you to multijump, walljump and glide by holding space, while they are in the back slot.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Version 1.3: Armour Up![/h1]\n\nAdded the following:\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]WIP[/b] tier 2,3,4 and 5 armours. Crafted same way as the wasp wings through an item obtained at the apothecary, these sets of armour provide you with same benefits as EPP packs of appropriate level when the full set is worn. You can mix and match the pieces of these four sets, but you will only receive the lowest tier protection - if you have T2 legs, T3 chest and T4 head you will only receive a bonus same as if you were wearing a breathing EPP.\n[*] Paper cup and kettle set.\n[*] Paper desk and chair.\n[*] Large stained glass window object.\n[*] Paper plate object, allowing you to display items in it (only displays items with set icons).\n[*] Racial Flag.\n[/list]\n\nFor FU users - currently the armours provide extreme immunities to radiation/cold/heat of same level as normal protection - T3 for radiation, T4 for cold and T5 for heat.\n\n\nThis race is being actively developed, please post suggestions below, and they will be considered.\n\n\n[i]In the works:[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] Race specific craftable armor sets that include an extra set bonus when you have all of the pieces equipped\n[*] Race specific craftable weapons\n[*] Even more Wasp hive paper furniture\n[/list]\n\nWasp Hive is compatible with the A.V.I.A.N. mod.\n\nTo play as a Wasp Hive, you need a race extender mod to allow you to select it.

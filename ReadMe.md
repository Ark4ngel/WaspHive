## Installation

1. Download the most recent release (either [here](https://github.com/GTG3000/WaspHive/releases) or in the [forums](http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/wasp-hive-racemod.4235/)) and place the .pak file in your mods folder. Or make your life easy and subscribe on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=770083792).  

2. To play as a Wasp Hive, you'll need a race extender mod in order to select it. [XBAWKS](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729426722) is a safe bet if you don't know which to choose.  

3. Optional: There is an alternate version of the tier 8 ship that can exclusively be found on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=779936328). This version has double the 'greenhouse' space of the original.

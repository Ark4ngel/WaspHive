    "The Hives are a fascinating race and I'm so glad to be a part of the expedition that discovered them. Even though we're calling them 'wasps' for now, they aren't quite like anything found on Earth.",
	"For one thing, their biology and family structure is different from what we'd expected.  From our distant observations, we had assumed that they were similar to hive insects on Earth, with many individuals working for the good of the colony. Making contact proved us wrong! Each hive is one individual, one mind spread out over thousands of bodies. The hive we encountered was curious and reached out to communicate with us. It seems that concept of many individuals working together is novel to them.",
	"Over the next few weeks we found out that the hive wasps are pretty much genderless. All of the procreation is handled by the brain of the hive, the queen, who decides what kind of drone to produce, or even to make a new queen. Surprisingly, it seems that queens even have the ability to change their own biology and form at will. The hive we're communicating with has altered itself multiple times during our visit in efforts to appear less threatening, in response to comments from the crew.",
	"It seems that prior to this encounter, the hives had no concept of family other than as labor. New queens were treated as the most specialized type of drones. They were sent away to establish a new colony and made to send resources back to the â€˜maternal' hive under threat of hostility. Under our guidance, we are witnessing first group of hives to work together, spawned by inspired queens. They've even made an effort to look like us. I wonder if hives will become a part of the protectorate now, with our help?"

    "I am hive under a hill near a river. Hive in the big flower field insulted me, said I can't write. Hive can anything! So I write.",
	"Hive doesn't know what to write. Hive doesn't have vassals. Hive writes supplies, but that's not enough?",
	"Sometimes Hive wonders if other hives are like Hive. They all are stupid and rude to Hive, so hive doesn't know.",
	"Today Hive seen a shiny bug! Hive seen it with five hunter bodies! Could it be a body of another hive? Hive will investigate.",
	"Hive tracked down the shiny! Hive is exhausted by travel, but the shiny is a body of hive in the big forest. Will hive teach Hive?",
	"Hive decided to ask hive in the big forest to teach Hive the shiny body. Hive will send bodies with gifts. Hive will give sweet! Hive doesn't want to share sweet, but hive wants shiny more.",
	"Hive in the big forest agreed to teach Hive shiny body. Hive will make it my treasure! Hive will make queen shiny! But Hive will have to trade fish from river for wood, too. Unfair.",
	"Hive didn't write for a long time. Hive was happy with the shiny body. But tonight Hive seen something shiny to fly through the sky! Shiny looked like a very big falling star and howled loudly. Hive will investigate.",
	"Hive found something in the direction the falling star fell. Hive found something Hive never seen - a house appeared on the ground between Hive and hive in the big forest. Strange bodies are walking around it. Hive doesn't think they are a hive."

    "The Wasp Hives were discovered by the Terrene Protectorate in a state of primitive medieval culture - each Hive was a veritable kingdom of their own, with one queen acting as the brain and many drones acting as queen's eyes and hands.",

	"The advanced telepathy discovered in the species provides the queen with unmatched ability to project her will, to the point of there being no distinction between the hive and herself - at the cost of there being only one mind for thousands of bodies. This singular mind had long limited the Hives' scientific progress.",

	"Cooperation such as that which would allow the hives to pool their resources and dedicate one queen to research was almost nonexistent in the pre-Terrene era.",

	"The humans, eager to interact with the newly discovered race, promptly started the biggest revolution in the history of the hives by showing them the benefits of having many independent minds working towards common goals. This forever split the grand hive kingdoms into many smaller Hives, ultimately resulting in the self-sufficient wasps we meet today.",

	"Each of the hives is quick to tell you that they are a proud and powerful hive all by their lonesome - no matter if they only have one drone or a hundred."
